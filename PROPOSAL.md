Put your final project proposal here.

For my final project, I plan on making a Candy Crush game. When in late elementary school and early middle school, candy
crush was a game that I played pretty often, so I thought it would be fun to recreate it! I donâ€™t have a whole lot of
background knowledge on the project, besides what I picked up from playing the game on my device.

I will begin by designing my overall class structure and what methods should go in each class. By the end of week one, I
will have created the basic structure of the board and filled it with randomized candies. I also will start on creating
the algorithm for switching two candies and removing them when there are three in a row and replacing the empty boxes
with the candies above them. This will probably take a while to figure out, but I should have finished implementing this
by the end of week two. For the last week, I will figure out points by implementing a system so that you have a certain
number of turns to reach the point goal, or else you lose. I will be doing testing my testing throughout the project.

Lastly, if I finish early, I will try implementing the extra candies. For example, if there is a four in a row, you get
a striped candy that allows you to clear a whole row, or if you get a five in a row, you get a donut that allows you to
clear all the candies of a certain type. If I somehow have a lot of extra time, I might try a different game format,
such as a timed game.
